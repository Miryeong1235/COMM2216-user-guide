# Overview of MySQL user documentation

HelloðŸ‘‹
This documentation guides you setting up your MySQL schema. 

We are going to explain
- how to create a schema
- how to create test tables
- how to write SELECT statements to retrieve information from tables 

We also provide sample SQL statements, so you can use MySQL by yourself and run queries without any prior knowledge.


## How we collaborated together

We maintained regular in-person meetings to ensure alignment and mutual understanding.
We used Git and GitHub to collaborate on the documentation. We began by assigning tasks, and upon completing the initial draft, we provided feedback to one another, making adjustments to enhance readability and design.


## How we created our guide

Our guide was created based on our expertise gained from setting up and utilizing MySQL in COMP 2714 Relational Database Systems. 
We supplemented our experiential knowledge with references from the official MySQL documentation and setup instructions provided by the course instructor. 
Reflecting on the challenges we encountered during MySQL setup for the lecture, we ensured our instructions remained clear, comprehensive, and concise.


### Using MkDocs

We decided to use MkDocs as our static site generator due to its visually appealing [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme and the comprehensive components offered by MkDocs.


### Using Markdown

We were not familiar to using Markdown. We acquired the ability to style text using Markdown through our COMM 2116 Business Communications 2 course, and developed our skills throughout the process of writing this documentation.


### Using VS Code

We both utilized VS Code for writing our markdown files. 
To ensure accurate rendering of our styles, we previewed our guide by serving it with MkDocs when necessary.
