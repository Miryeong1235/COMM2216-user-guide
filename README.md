# Overview of MySQL user documentation

## What is this user documentation?
This documentation guides readers setting up their MySQL schema. We created this documentation in COMM　2522 Business Communication 2.

In the documentation, we explained
- how to create a schema
- how to create test tables
- how to write SELECT statements to retrieve information from tables 

We also provide sample SQL statements, so that readers can use MySQL by themselves and run queries without any prior knowledge.

We created this user documentation by using Mkdocs, Markdown, and Visual Studio Code.
You can see deployed [our user guide](https://miryeong1235.github.io/COMM2216-user-guide/)


## How we collaborated together

We maintained regular in-person meetings to ensure alignment and mutual understanding.
We used Git and GitHub to collaborate on the documentation. We began by assigning tasks, and upon completing the initial draft, we provided feedback to one another, making adjustments to enhance readability and design.


## How we created our guide

Our guide was created based on our expertise gained from setting up and utilizing MySQL in our course COMP 2714 Relational Database Systems. We supplemented our experiential knowledge with references from the official MySQL documentation and setup instructions provided by the course instructor. 

We used the following tools to develop the website and collaborate with a partner.

### MkDocs

We decided to use MkDocs as our static site generator due to its visually appealing [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme and the comprehensive components offered by MkDocs. At first, we took time to understand how it works and how to setup the environment by watching a tutorial video. After understanding the basic concept of MkDocs, we started to write documentation in Visual Studio Code.

### Markdown

We have used markdown for readme in previous development projects. However, this was our first experience to write a whole document with markdown.
We enhanced the ability to style text using Markdown throughout the process of writing this documentation. We learned how to write variety of expression used in markdown such as admonitions, links, and code blocks.

### Visual Studio Code

We both used Visual Studio Code for writing our markdown files. 
To ensure accurate rendering of our styles, we previewed our guide by serving it with MkDocs when necessary.

## What we leaned from this project

We covered both of instructions and web writing in this project. We learned the best practices for both from our experience.

### Best practices for instructions
- For clear instruction, we should start with an action verb for instruction steps. Starting a sentence with action verbs enables readers to understand what to do clearly.
- We should include only one instruction in one step. Having several instructions in one step can cause readers to misunderstand the instructions and/or ignore the instructions.
- We should separate additional information from instructive steps. Additional information should be provided with different styles.


### Best practices for web writing
- We should use headings effectively. Web users typically scan information as they scroll. By providing relevant and informative headings, readers can find the information they need without having to read carefully.
- To enhance readability, we should utilize visual elements such as callouts and code blocks. These components help readers quickly understand the type of information being provided.
- We should strive to keep our sentences concise and use simple language.　Avoiding the use of complex words or expressions ensures that readers can understand the instructions or explanations with just one read.


## Conclusion
Through this project, we have not only conveyed how to set up MySQL to our intended readers but also deepened our understanding of instruction writing. We have learned the essence of writing effective instructions that enable readers to take the correct actions. Additionally, this project has facilitated our technical growth in creating online documents using MkDocs.

We believe our documentation skills have improved through learning theory and practice.

Thank you for your interest in our MySQL User Documentation. We believe that this documentation will be a valuable resource for our readers in their future projects.
