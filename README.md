# Overview of MySQL user documentation

HelloðŸ‘‹
This documentation guides you setting up your MySQL schema. 

We are going to explain
- how to create a schema
- how to create test tables
- how to write SELECT statements to retrieve information from tables 

We also provide sample SQL statements, so you can use MySQL by yourself and run queries without any prior knowledge.


## How we collaborated together

We maintained regular in-person meetings to ensure alignment and mutual understanding.
We used Git and GitHub to collaborate on the documentation. We began by assigning tasks, and upon completing the initial draft, we provided feedback to one another, making adjustments to enhance readability and design.
