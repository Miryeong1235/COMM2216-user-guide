# Overview of MySQL user documentation

## What is this user documentation?
This documentation guides readers setting up their MySQL schema. We created this documentation in COMMã€€2522 Business Communication2.

In the documentation, we explained
- how to create a schema
- how to create test tables
- how to write SELECT statements to retrieve information from tables 

We also provide sample SQL statements, so that readers can use MySQL by themselves and run queries without any prior knowledge.
We created this user documentation by using Mkdocs, Markdown, and Visual Studio Code.

## How we collaborated together

We maintained regular in-person meetings to ensure alignment and mutual understanding.
We used Git and GitHub to collaborate on the documentation. We began by assigning tasks, and upon completing the initial draft, we provided feedback to one another, making adjustments to enhance readability and design.


## How we created our guide

Our guide was created based on our expertise gained from setting up and utilizing MySQL in our course COMP 2714 Relational Database Systems. 
We supplemented our experiential knowledge with references from the official MySQL documentation and setup instructions provided by the course instructor. 
Reflecting on the challenges we encountered during MySQL setup for the lecture, we ensured our instructions remained clear, comprehensive, and concise.


### MkDocs

We decided to use MkDocs as our static site generator due to its visually appealing [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme and the comprehensive components offered by MkDocs. At first, we took time to understand how it works and how to setup the environment by watching a tutorial video. After understanding the basic concept of MkDocs, we started to write documentation in Visual Studio Code.


### Markdown

We have been used markdown for a readme in previous development projects. However, this was our first experience to write a whole document with markdown.
We enhanced the ability to style text using Markdown throughout the process of writing this documentation. We learned how to write variety of expression used in markdown such as admonitions, links, and code blocks.


### Visual Studio Code

We both used Visual Studio Code for writing our markdown files. 
To ensure accurate rendering of our styles, we previewed our guide by serving it with MkDocs when necessary.
