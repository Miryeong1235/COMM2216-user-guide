# MySQL starting guide
## Introduction

Helloüëã
This documentation guides you setting up your MySQL schema. We are going to explain how to create a schema, how to create test tables, and how to write SELECT statements to retrieve information from tables. We also provide sample SQL statements, so you can use MySQL by yourself and run queries without any prior knowledge.


### About SQL and relational database
‚ÄúSQL‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúStructured Query Language‚Äù. SQL is designed for data definition, data manipulation, and data control, powerful enough to retrieve any piece of data from a database. MySQL is an open-source relational database provided by Oracle. 

A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big storeroom. The database structure is organized into physical files optimized for speed. 
MySQL powers many most accessed applications, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, Shopify, and Booking.com.

- MySQL community (v8.0.x)
    - For Windows, download from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/){target="-black"}
    - For Mac, download from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/){target="-black"}
- MySQL workbench

MySQL community is a freely downloadable version of MySQL. MySQL workbench is the official graphic user interface (GUI) tool for MySQL.

## Procedures overview
The main sections of the documentation are summarized below:

1. Create a new schema
1. Create test tables
1. Retrieve information from tables

## Typographical conventions
We provide SQL statements in the following code blocks:

- We provide some code snippets for explaining syntax in this format.
``` sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1;
```

- We provide some sample codes to use in your MySQL in this format.

    !!! example "Sample query"
        ```
        SELECT * 
        FROM Dog;
        ```

    The sample code is folded when it is long.

    ??? example "Sample Code"
        ``` SQL
        <!-- sample SQL code here -->
        ```
